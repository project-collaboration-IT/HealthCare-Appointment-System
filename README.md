(If you have no Git set up yet, do this)

First, download all files uploaded.
Create a folder named "healthcare" then paste the contents of database branch
(yes, pull the files from "databasebranch" not the main)
Then, make sure all the files are complete and have no errors within.
Then your frontend is complete.

For the backend, create a folder under the same parent folder as "healthcare", not inside healthcare
Name it "HealthCare-Backend"
Download the "HealthCare-Backend" files only in main
Extract the files and it must be directly under "HealthCare-Backend" not inside any folder
Then open terminal in vs and initialize (npm init -y)
Then install dependencies (npm install express cors firebase-admin bcryptjs dotenv) and (npm install --save-dev nodemon)

Make sure all files are good to go.
Open terminal in back end and type (npm run dev or npm start)
Open terminal in front end and type (npm start)

Now you are good to go!
